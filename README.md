# Decision-tree-based-blending-method-using-deep-learning-for-network-management

In this paper, we present a novel ensemble model for network traffic classification. Specifically, the proposed ensemble deploys a blending ensemble learning method to combine tree-based classifiers in order to maximize generalization accuracy. Using two datasets (non-encrypted and encrypted network traffic), we show that our proposed ensemble is suitable for network traffic classification and outperforms several well-known ML models, which are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), AdaBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), LightGBM, Catboost, and XGBoost.  


We performed our experiments using well-known libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and Keras.
